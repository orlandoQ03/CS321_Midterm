        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is a blog that is used to showcase my brand, either about me
            or gigs that I'm working on. Subjects may include daily thoughts,
            news about my community, announcements, food for thought, or just
            thinking out loud. Blogs like these will not only present who 
            I am as a person, but also push my brand towards future
